#Background
A fun project to learn GoLang and brush up on my React. Pokemon is currently my game of choice to relax after work and as usual I must know everything about the mechanics of something I like.

#Run the project

- Clone gopoke-api
- go run app.go to start the backend
- npm run dev to start the frontend
